             <span>Involvement in this project is voluntary.  It is expected to take under 10 minutes to complete.<br><br>

                    Participants are expected to have at least 2 years experience in the provision of neuraxial anaesthesia in obstetrics.<br><br>

                    The information gathered within the study is intended for submission as part of an MSc dissertation.  It may also be submitted for academic publication/presentation.  No identifiable data relating to your involvement will be retained.<br><br>

                    No clinical decision making is assessed in the study, all information that is required to be recorded is provided at the top of each screen .  The study aims to quantatively assess how design of user interface of a simulated health record system may impact quality and safety of the record.<br><br>

                    You will be presented with 10 scenarios relating to provision of neuraxial anaesthesia for obstetric surgery.  These scenarios will be presented twice, with empty fields or with some prefilled information.  The order of presentation of these will be randomised for each participant.  A brief clinical scenario will be present at the top of the screen which includes all information expected to be entered.<br><br>

                    There are 2 demonstration screens which follow this page to show the 2 types of presentation.  After these the data capture begins.  Once in the study please consider speed and accuracy to be your priority in terms of performance.
